excel-challenge questions  


1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

Of the crowdfunding campaigns that were successful on average they were funded at about 200%. 

56.5% of the 1000 crowdfunding campaigns were successful. 

36.4% of the 1000 crowdfunding campaigns failed.  

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?

We are unable to draw any conclusions about canceled, failed, live and successful because it is unclear what the difference between those terms are. What does it mean that a crowdfunding campaign is live versus successful, and canceled versus failed? The (blub) column seems to have data that could be potentially useful or provide clearer insights into the themes with successful and failed campaigns however it is not organized in a manner at this time that is useful. 

3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

Creating a table that would organize the data by the crowdfunding campaigns created time and ended time to see if there is any correlation of how long campaigns were live for and how much funding they raised. Analyzing and organizing the blurb data could provide information. Analyzing the mean, median, and mode of the average donation could provide insight for future teams seeking funding on donation amounts to request upfront potentially.
